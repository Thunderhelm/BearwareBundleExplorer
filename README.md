# BearwareBundleExplorer
A basic tool for editing and working with raw bundle data. Currently contains the indevelopment version of bundle functionality. Bundles will not need the explorer in the future, but as the explorer is built to be a powerful debugging tool, it is being developed along-side the standard to help in it's creation. No projects should be using either yet.
